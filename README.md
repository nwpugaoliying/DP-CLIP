## Requirements

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(we use /torch 1.13.1 / torchvision 0.14.1 /cuda 11.7 / 12G for training and evaluation.
```

### Datasets

- For Fine-grained ZS-SBIR:
  - [Sketchy](https://github.com/AnjanDutta/sem-pcyc/) (basic) dataset having fine-grained sketch-photo associations.

- For Category-level ZS-SBIR:
  - [Sketchy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGtssYgM6_r0ph8f_ZPWzIHvHL0yS8CN/view?usp=sharing) (extended).
  - [TUBerlin](https://github.com/AnjanDutta/sem-pcyc/).


## Training

We utilize 1 GPU for training.

```bash
sh train.sh
```

**or you can directly test with following yml and commands:**

## Evaluation

```bash
sh test.sh
```

For evaluation only, you could download our trained model from [Google](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wOLuKUQCIbrQ4B49iZuuUPd7mK9QChn0/view?usp=sharing)
